# Microcontroller Texting
This project involves using an IR reciever to intercept the transmissions from a TV remote. We use thos transmissions in order to type out a message using the T9 format. This message can then be viewed on an OLED screen connected through SPI before it is sent out to another microcontroller through UART.
